# Introduction

warm greetings to all readers
I am giovixo97, a lover of web exploitation, and I will now present to you the solutions proposed for the CTF carried out by Hack The Box or Cyber Apocalypse. I would like to point out loud and clear how grateful I am to my mentor mattsec35, who with great patience has always guided me through any computer security course during the CTFs. he is always precise, exhaustive and even simple in his explanations, which are the things I find most rarely around. You are most welcome in this folder of proposed solutions, thank you for stopping by. Happy hacking to all.
